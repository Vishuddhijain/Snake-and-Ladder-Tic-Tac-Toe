# 🎮 Snake and Ladder & Tic-Tac-Toe – C++ Mini Project

This beginner-friendly C++ project brings two timeless games — **Snake and Ladder** and **Tic-Tac-Toe** — into a single console-based application. Designed as a hands-on introduction to game logic, turn-based mechanics, and user interaction in C++, it supports both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs Computer** modes.

---

##  Overview

This project aims to strengthen C++ fundamentals through interactive gameplay development. With a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **CLI-based interaction**, it offers modular, easy-to-follow code for educational and recreational use.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:** Classes, Functions, Arrays, Loops, Conditionals
- **Interface:** Command Line (Console)
